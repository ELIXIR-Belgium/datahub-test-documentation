See for yourself how DataHub is being used or where it has been integrated in.

## Export your experiments to ISA-JSON format



## ENA-upload tool

Use your experimental structure from DataHub to submit metadata to ENA. A step-by-step guide on how to export your metadata from DataHub and use the ENA upload tool to submit to ENA can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/use-cases/ena-upload-tool#step-by-step-guide).

## MARS

MARS is a data brokering initiative for submitting multi-omics life sciences studies to multiple specialized repositories.
DataHub plays the role of ISA-JSON producing platform and will be able to produce an ISA-JSON which can be consumed by the MARS CLI tool to perform a multi-omic submission.

More information of this initiative can be found on GitHub: <https://github.com/elixir-europe/MARS>.
